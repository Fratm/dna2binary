# dns2binary
Stupid little project to convert DNA sequences to 2 bit binary.. No reason for this, just somethign someone mentioned to me so I played around with it.

* Some bits of this code were re-worked by chatGPT in the process of trouble shooting.
* dnaFruitFly.txt is just a dna sequence of a fruit fly, it is only a fraction of the DNA and it is repeating just so I have some data to play with.  It is probable not accurate.
* This is released to public domain, because.. well why not?
